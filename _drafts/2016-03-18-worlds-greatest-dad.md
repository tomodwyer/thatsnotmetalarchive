description: "Hill and Beez are destroyed by the new Reckless Love album and it's not pretty. There's chat on the new Metallica and Suicide Silence albums, Placebo's 20th Anniversary, Tool's writers block, album reviews include the recent Iggy Pop and Josh Homme, Marudergrind and Hands Like Houses and we are honoured to be joined by David from the legendary Refused to discuss one of the starting points for European death metal, Entombed's Left Hand Path."
