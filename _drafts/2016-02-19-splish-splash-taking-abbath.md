description: "Hill and Beez marvel at the outrage of Oli Sykes standing on a table, there's a report of Parkway Drive's UK tour, reviews come in the shape of The King Blues, Creeper, Abbath and The King Is Blind, there's discussion on great albums with booty artwork and Album Club is Killswitch Engage's Alive Or Just Breathing. Vote President Frog!"
