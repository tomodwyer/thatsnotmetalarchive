description: "It’s one of the podcasts of the year as Hill and Beez guide you through the great and not so great from this year’s entire Download line-up. Who will steal the weekend? Which bands are the festival’s hidden gems? Who will stink worse than that poo you take when you get home from eating festival food for 5 days? It’s all here alongside your questions answered. See you at Donington Park next weekend!"
