description: "This week, Hill and Beez are joined by Sam and Tom from Architects to talk about their new album, All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us, discuss on stage selfies, the importance of image in rock music and answer your awesome questions. We also review their new album and the new EP from Grove Street Families and we wrap things up with an Album Club on Funeral For A Friend's 'Casually Dressed...'. Oh and of course we asked them if they'd w*nk off Ozzy Osbourne for £100,00. Obvs."
