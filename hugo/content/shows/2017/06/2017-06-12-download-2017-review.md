title: Download 2017 Review
date: 2017-06-12
description: Hill and Beez discuss the highs, the lows and the dry sock euphoria from this year’s Download Festival. Some big questions about what the Download public wants, an order of humble pie, alcohol being brilliant, some of the best sets in the history of the Download era and all of the usual laughs…especially at Beez’s stupid, croaky voice.
