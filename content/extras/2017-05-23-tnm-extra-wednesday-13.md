description: "In one of our most fun chats ever, Beez sits down with Wednesday 13 to discuss his new album, Condolences, there's chats on conspiracy theories, Star Wars, a disagreement on Get Out, the past, present and future of The Murderdolls, the state of rebellion in rock and roll in 2017 and the power of longevity through authenticity. Fang bang, motherfuckers!"
