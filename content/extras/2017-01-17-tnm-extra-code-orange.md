description: "The first ever TNM Extra involves a little chat from Beez on what you can expect from this new venture and, much more importantly, Stephen Hill catches up with Reba Meyers and Jami Morgan of Code Orange to talk about the state of rock, the risks taken on their outstanding new album Forever and whether a band from hardcore can ever truly make a shattering impact on the world of rock."
