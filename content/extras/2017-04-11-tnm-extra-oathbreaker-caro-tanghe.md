description: After releasing one of the most groundbreaking albums in the recent history of rock music, Beez sits down with Caro Tanghe of Oathbreaker to discuss their landmark album, Rheia, just how far a person is willing to push themselves physically and mentally for their art and how you difficult it is to take art that delves into the darkest parts of your emotions on the road and onto the stage. This is an interview not to be missed.
