description: We have no idea how many questions we asked (it’s just a good title) as Hill & Beez travel back in time to tackle one of those old school MySpace quizzes in what is one of the all-time greatest podcasts we’ve ever recorded.

This is one of those specials where you’re going to get funny looks when you start cracking up whether at home or in public. Hill & Beez on the form of their life. Enjoy, apologies about the Steel Panther interview but we are certain that you’ll agree that this more than makes up for it.
