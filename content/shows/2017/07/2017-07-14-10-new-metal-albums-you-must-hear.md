date: 2017-07-14
description: Hill and Beez take you on a voyage of discovery as we bring you 10 metal albums that are flying under the radar of mainstream attention but kick all kinds of ass. Everything from nasty thrash and a hulked up NOWBHM revival to a band that you will fall in love with if you adore early Mastodon, from a commercial metalcore band that actually remembers the metal part of that deal to urban hardcore and a band for fans of both Nails and Bathory alike to get into, this is a one stop guide to some really incredible metal bands that may have passed you by so far in 2017 (this starts at the half hour mark).
