## Questions

* **[Ross White](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2136343583258841?comment_id=2136345379925328&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _What do you think is the biggest rock/metal anthem of the 21st century? Something like enter sandman or teen spirit for the 90's. I would say duality or chop suey, anything better than those and is there any from this decade?_
* **[Lenny Reid](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2136343583258841?comment_id=2136353489924517&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _Funk songs mention "the funk" a lot. Disco always bangs on about "the boogie". Dance tends to tell you that "the bass" is quite important. Is there something similar that often crops up in rock and metal songs? Or what is the most overused trope in rock/metal that makes your eyes roll?_
