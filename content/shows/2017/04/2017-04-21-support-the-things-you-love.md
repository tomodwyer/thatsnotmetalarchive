With Tool actually playing a show and the Misfits reunion last year, would the opportunity to watch it via paid stream/ tv channel be a good thing? And would it actually be feesable?_
* **[Simon Dixon](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/2091161454443721/?type=3&comment_id=2091268184433048&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R4%22%7D)**: _Getting older and lazier, I've found myself trending towards getting seated tickets at metal gigs. What are your thoughts on being seated during a gig? Also, what is the etiquette in the seated section of gigs (re: standing etc) and what are the bands you would NEVER be seated for?_

My vote would be for Enter Shikari or Letlive._
