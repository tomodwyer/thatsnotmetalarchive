Maiden & rammstein play to lighting and pyro timings whilst, having witnessed a few Springsteen shows (don't judge me lol) he takes requests directly from the crowd. There are pros and cons to both I just wondered what your views were._

Would you rather see these kinds of bands continue to be the masters of club shows or see them reach to headline somewhere like Brixton with a full production set up?_
