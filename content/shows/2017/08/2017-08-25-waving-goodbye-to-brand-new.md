## Questions

* **[Phil Tessier](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2164595870433612?comment_id=2164787357081130&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R2%22%7D):** Whenever people are asked to pick an album that defines or encapsulates heavy metal, they tend to give similar answers like Master of Puppets or Reign in Blood, both of which came out in the mid-eighties. Steve has mentioned a more modern pick with City of Evil, but even that album is now 12 years old. So what truly "modern" album, say from 2010 till now, do you think could join these classics as an album you'd give someone and say "THIS is metal music."

Do you think the US actually gets better shows, or is it a case of the grass being greener on the other side? As there are pitfalls like longer travel times.
