* **[Ryan Jenkins](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2152896628270203?comment_id=2152911864935346&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: Bloodstock hidden diamonds to check out next weekend? First time attending, and not clued up with a fair few names on the bill.
* **[Michael Guy Perry](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2152896628270203?comment_id=2152908808268985&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: TNM gets press accreditation for the Gathering of the Juggalos. Do you go? And if so, on a scale of 1-10, how Juggalo would you go? 1 being refusing to set foot outside the press area for fear of catching something, and 10 being getting totally clowned up, sharing a minging trailer and showering in Faygo all weekend, and running the Drug Bridge gauntlet?

And are there things from the states that you'd like to see across the pond?
