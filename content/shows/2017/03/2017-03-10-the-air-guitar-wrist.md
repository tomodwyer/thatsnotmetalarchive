## Questions

_Why the obsession with mainstream acceptance and acknowledgement?, it seems like all you have been banging on about for a coupla weeks. Genuine question. I've been a part of this scene since the early 80's and no one has ever taken metal seriously, and tbh I quite like it that way. I don't listen to Dillinger because I want validation from my window cleaner._

_You mentioned in the last TNM episode about the fact that we as rock fans get treated "differently" or sub normally compared to fans of other genres. The stereotype of the grunger in the office etc._

_Although I agree with you that the mainstream "don't get it", do you think that the culture of the late 90's we inflicted on ourselves has influenced the way the world sees us. Programmes such as Beavis and Butthead and such like, portrayed us as numbskulls and morons, and these were made by people from our world in a way. Since then we've almost embraced this stereotype within our world by living up to the beards, stoner attitude, billy bullet belt black t shirt brigade. I can almost understand why the outside work stereotypes us with the moron metal head tag._

_Is it too late to change the way the world sees us, the bits and the grammys? Should we just accept that this is it for us?_

_Do u guys think that if the new System of a Down, At the Drive in and Tool(hopefully) records are as amazing and innovative as some of there previous works it could re spark an interest in the genre and an attempt to evolve and create new sounds in rock and metal, bcz to my ears a lot of what is going around, at least in the mainstream, are band trying to rehash sounds from bands from the 70s and 80s and watering down their sound to the point its bland pop with no personality, attitude or aggression. Love the show and hope to here your opinions on the matter._

_I'm almost 40, my first love was Appetite for Destruction and current favourite bands are Code Orange and Die Antwoord. Here's my two penneth. I think in general 'heavy' music is no longer heavy, its lightweight, non-confrontational, PC, all-bark-no-bite and bland and boring because of it. If it gains popularity, which to me was never what this was all about, it'll be because its safe and comfortable. Beez keeps asking where are the rock stars?, they're doing innuendo bingo with Scott Mills mate. Where is the danger?, its either playing songs from 30 years ago or getting judged and criticised by the rest of the scene. Its been said that this will be the first generation where the kids are more straight-laced and conventional than their parents and this is reflected in the music they produce. If I sound like an 'it was better in my day' I'm really not, I listen to brand new music all the time but if I want edgy and original, Metal is no longer where I look._

_I'm a 42 year old man who is taking his daughter to slamdunk this year. I'm a fan of harder music, less of the pop more of the punk. What bands should I check out?_

### [Andy Rutherford](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2064789643747569?comment_id=2064819790411221&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)

_Should Eddie Vedder charge so much for solo shows (£90+), when Pearl Jam tickets were a lot cheaper for a better venue in 2014? Especially as he is someone who has previously spoken out against companies like Ticketmaster ripping fans off?_

_You guys talk about vinyl a lot now - if you have a setup where are displaying your vinyl as art in your home as well as playing it regularly, which vinyl do you by in terms of best albums that have the best artwork (3 records each)_
