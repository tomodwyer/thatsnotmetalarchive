Do you consider them to be one of us? They have had turbo wolf support them as well as what will be the mars volta etc. Also Ben wore an architects t shirt at Glastonbury. Thoughts?*

You get offered a pilot of "Later with Beez and Bimsy" to prove it could work. What four bands do you choose on the basis that you can't have anyone who has ever been on with Jools Holland and your aim is to show the diversity of rock and metal but also get good enough viewing figures to get a series commissioned.*
