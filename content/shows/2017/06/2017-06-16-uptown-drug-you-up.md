## Questions

The bands were great (Blink 182, Gojira, Skinny Puppy one after the other... bit all right) but the atmosphere was nothing like Download UK. It was just lacking the personality, the charm that's made me love Download UK, even when it shits it down. Obviously it takes more than JUST great bands to make a great festival, so what do you think new-ish festivals ought to take into consideration? Because Download Paris had the name and the dog, but apart from that it was just a load of greebs in a field with some ace bands playing_

Does the public perception of the festival/its audience prevent Download from every really expanding its demographic?\*
