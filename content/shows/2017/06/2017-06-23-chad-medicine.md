## Questions

* **[Joe Heaton](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2127369030822963?comment_id=2127379670821899&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _Given that Machine Head are posting studio teasers on their Facebook what are your hopes for the next record? Seeing as Bloodstone & Diamonds was great we'd all be forgiven for wanting more of the same, however its lack of attention from the metal community might persuade them into trying something different (like last year's single). If this is the case can you see it working out well?_
* **[Ryan Harkness](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2127369030822963?comment_id=2127383094154890&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _If you could be involved and have influence over the recording and production of ANY band's next album, which band would it be and why? (this can be purely for selfish reasons)_
* **[Ben Willmott](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2127369030822963?comment_id=2127403814152818&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _Do you think bands should sometimes drop some or all the big hitters from their sets (the Enter Sandmans and Number Of The Beasts etc) and replace them more rarer gems, given that a lot of fans watching a bigger band is have probably seen them multiple times over the years, or do bands have a duty to keep at least some of those big hitters in for any new fans turning up?_
