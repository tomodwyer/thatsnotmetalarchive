Which rock or metal bands would you like to see do Eurovision?(either metal bands on the normal Eurovision or a hypothetical "Metal Eurovision") Rammstein for Germany, Reckless Love for Finland and Airbourne for Australia would be some of my picks. What about you guys?_

Can you see any examples of where this may have occurred in our world but no one has noticed?_
