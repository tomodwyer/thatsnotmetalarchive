* **[Andy Payne](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2110898002470066?comment_id=2110916505801549&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _I went to see CKY at The Underworld on Sunday, the gig was surprisingly good but I don't think I have ever been surrounded by so many dickheads! People were cramming the small stairway to the pit area and being really aggressive if you tried to get through, I even saw two guys shove a girl just because she had asked to get past. Crowdsurfers were trying to start fights with the bouncers and after the band had left, people were smashing bottles and glasses on the floor. I feel like these are the twats that give rock and metal fans a bad name and also the reason some of my friends get really nervous and apprehensive about going to gigs. What can we do to stop this from happening and how can we show the outside world that we aren't like this most of the time?_
