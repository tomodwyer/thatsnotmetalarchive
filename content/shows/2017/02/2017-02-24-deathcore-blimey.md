- **[Phillip Rose](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2057192451173955?comment_id=2057202047839662&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: *With metal an rock becoming more present in society (as mentioned last week with the primark t-shirts etc) do you think we will ever see a PROPER metal band on the Brits then? An who would be your pick to play to give people an idea of what metal is like currently?? I would love while she sleeps or architects but feel it probably needs to be a more palatable band. Haha*

- **[Gregory Fletcher Blanton](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2057192451173955?comment_id=2057212917838575&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: *Will the move to L.A. provide more access to U.S.-based bands for interviews and generally result in more coverage of American artists? Since all rockers these days are going country, will Beez leave That's Not Metal, buy a cowboy hat, and start That's Not Country with Danny Worsnop?*
