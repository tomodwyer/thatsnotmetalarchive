* **[Phillip Rose](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2057192451173955?comment_id=2057202047839662&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _With metal an rock becoming more present in society (as mentioned last week with the primark t-shirts etc) do you think we will ever see a PROPER metal band on the Brits then? An who would be your pick to play to give people an idea of what metal is like currently?? I would love while she sleeps or architects but feel it probably needs to be a more palatable band. Haha_
* **[Oliver Harper](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2057192451173955?comment_id=2057218914504642&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _Considering a lot of people are now saying Grime is the new Punk and the new voice of the young and disillusioned, will Punk and Hardcore ever come back to claim that or is Grime too big now and Punk too underground and what are your thoughts on this?_
* **[Gregory Fletcher Blanton](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2057192451173955?comment_id=2057212917838575&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _Will the move to L.A. provide more access to U.S.-based bands for interviews and generally result in more coverage of American artists? Since all rockers these days are going country, will Beez leave That's Not Metal, buy a cowboy hat, and start That's Not Country with Danny Worsnop?_
