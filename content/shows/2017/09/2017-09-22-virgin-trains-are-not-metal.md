## Questions

* **[Euan Taylor](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2179354375624428?comment_id=2179357795624086&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: What are your thoughts on Robb Flynn saying that the new Machine Head album will see them at their most "grooving and melodic", does it concern you as much as it does me?
* **[Ashley Bebbington](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2179354375624428?comment_id=2179356402290892&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: What do you make of the news that Frank Turner is doing a camp for fans, with a ticket price of $1,000 - $3,000, in exchange for intimate shows, dinner, and music workshops with Frank and his band? The steep ticket price just seems exploitative to me, and for a self-proclaimed 'punk' to be doing this just doesn't sit right.
