## Questions

* **[Luke Keaveney](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2168496003376932?comment_id=2168517996708066&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: What do you think about bands getting writers in? I understand that a producer can help pave the wave of an album but getting a writer in I feel isnt real to the music. We listen to the metalz as it's real and you can relate to it. Do you think when band's do this there music loses credibility?
* **[Louis Tsangarides](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2168496003376932?comment_id=2168516066708259&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: Rou Reynolds went in on the way that Taylor Swift tickets are being sold. Do you think he is in the right, and could you see this method of ticket sales being taken up by the big rock and metal acts?
* **[Matt Wileman-Ashby](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2168496003376932?comment_id=2168505153376017&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: If you had to either have Tim Armstrong's voice or wear Cory Taylor's mask every time you left the house for the rest of your life what would you pick?
