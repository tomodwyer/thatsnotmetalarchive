My question is, whilst bands like neck deep, creeper, metallica and the likes make an effort with merch at their shows, should bands who don't make an effort and offer lazy designs be irked when bootleggers are selling better stuff outside the venue? A personal example was seeing grimes last year, she had about 2 tshirts for sale and both were very basic and not worth the 20/25 quid she was charging, outside bootleggers were flogging far better designs and people were snapping them up. I can understand neck deep being pissed off as their new merch looks decent but not all bands go to the same lengths.*
