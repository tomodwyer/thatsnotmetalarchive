What great bands have you discovered through awful covers?_
* **[Tom Joyce](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2193362394223626?comment_id=2193380547555144&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _When I was 15 I was completely obsessed with the Chili Peppers and I resolved to get a their logo tattooed upon my person. Which band would you have had tattooed when you were 15 and how would you feel about it now?_
* **[Andrew Davidson](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2193362394223626?comment_id=2193378594222006&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _What's the best use of a film/TV show sample you've heard in a song? I love the Die Hard clip in Parkway Drive's 'Guns for Show, Knives for a Pro' and 'Go on and smile, you cunt' from Marilyn Manson's 'Cake and Sodomy'._
* **[Theodor Spencer](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2193362394223626?comment_id=2193373947555804&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _Do you think that 'heaviness' in music is being redefined? I've seen Billy Bullet Belts say that bands like Shikari aren't heavy because of the electronics, and you've said before that people like Chelsea Wolfe bring a different kind of heavy to the table. I feel that this definition of heavy music is putting people off a lot of awesome new music (namely 'waa it's not heavy therefore it's rubbish waa'). Do you feel that there's a definition of heavy that people abide to, and does it need to be changed to reflect changes in our music?_
