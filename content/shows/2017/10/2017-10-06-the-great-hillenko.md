* **[Anthony Roach](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2186345761591956?comment_id=2186374431589089&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: _Your jobs involve listening to, hearing, rating, judging and enjoying a lot of different sounding albums. And the topic of production comes up a lot in your reviews. You often discuss how good the production is for certain artists or how it could have been different to improve the album. This had me thinking that surely at some point in your careers, you either have been or will be asked to either produce or be in some kind of advisery roll on someone's album? Have you ever been asked? Would you do it? Who would be your dream band to do this for?_
* **[Aaron (Quinndredd)](https://twitter.com/Quinndredd/status/916020872296755201)**: _So I've had the new Shikari album on pre order for months now, and I was dead excited for it's release, bought the most expensive option and sat and waited for the 22nd. We're now 2 weeks tomorrow since the release and nothing has arrived so far. Obviously the order is important, but after 2 weeks of waiting with nothing but an email telling me it's been sent, where do I cut my losses, and do I stop committing to ordering directly from the band, when I could have pick up a vinyl copy of The Spark 2 weeks ago from a HMV?_
