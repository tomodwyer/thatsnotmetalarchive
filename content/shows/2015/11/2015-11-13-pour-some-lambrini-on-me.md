description: Hill & Beez review the new albums from The Hell, Cryptopsy and the terrible, terrible, terrible new Def Leppard album. Seriously, it's terrible. System Of A Down's Toxicity stars in this week's Album Club and there's discussion on the Busted reunion, Volbeat, Motley Crue, Skindred, Trivium and more. But seriously that Def Leppard album is so terrible.
