description: "Hill and Beez discuss what is the best way to serve peanut butter on toast. Oh and there's rock and metal in the shape of Slayer, Anthrax and Refused live, reviews of the latest from Sikth, Baroness, Myrkur and Enter Shikari, Machine Head are this week's album club, we reveal who next week's massive TNM guest is and there's all of the usual discussion in between. You could say we are the Toast of the town...but don't."
