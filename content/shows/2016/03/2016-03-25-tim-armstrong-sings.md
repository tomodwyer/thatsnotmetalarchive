title: "Tim Armstrong Sings"
date: 2016-03-25
description: "Hill and Beez recreate some famous metal intros and Tim Armstrong pops in to sing a few famous hits*, there’s much lolz at the thought of Axl Rose in AC/DC, a look at the new Biffy Clyro and Andy Black songs, album reviews on Asking Alexandria, Amon Amarth and Walls of Jericho with Trivium’s The Crusade taking centre stage in this week’s Album Club. *This podcast does not contain the real Tim Armstrong…though it really sounds like it does."
