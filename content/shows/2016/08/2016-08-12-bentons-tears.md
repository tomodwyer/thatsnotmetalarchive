  _Would you rather fight: 1 x Pete Steele sized Lars Ulrich or 100 x Lars sized Pete Steele's._

  _What metal song you found most annoying like people would find the Macarena, gangnam style or agadoo etc?_

* [**Mike Tyler**](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/1936934526533082?comment_id=1936988493194352&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)
  _Last Friday, the O2 Arena published an article on their website entitled "4 bands GUARANTEED to make you a metal fan" (or something close to that). The four bands they listed were Black Sabbath, Alter Bridge, Bring Me The Horizon and Nickleback. All of these bands are playing the O2 in the near future so clearly an advertising article_
  _If you were picking 4 bands to try and turn someone into a metal fan, who would you choose and why? I think it would need to be a mix of classic and newer bands myself_

  _Name a killer record by a band whose discography is otherwise absolutely terrible!_

  _If you could go back in time and spend ten seconds with any band to just tell them something about their future, which band would you choose and what would you say?_
