### Question of the week

  _Covers more than metal, but ... Are we in danger of cheapening the deaths of our favourite artists?
  With the use of the Dio hologram at Wacken, touring holograms have been spoken about again. It's fine for one-offs like a song or two at an event like Wacken, but a tour?!
  When the 2Pac hologram made an appearance a few years ago there was a rush of "YEAH! We can get X to tour with Y again". People spoke about Queen touring with Freddie again, or getting Kurt Cobain to appear with Nirvana or with the Foos.
  It was treated as such an easy thing, but the novelty aspect was taking away from what these people did in their lives and careers, in my opinion.
  Now that the idea is doing the rounds again, my first thought is the same as it ever was: Fuck that! "Hey you! Did you get to see Elvis live? NO?! Well, now you can!" ... Fuck Off!
  I never got to see Queen with Freddie live, but I wouldn't replace that with a pre-recorded glorified animation. I'd rather crack open a cool beer and stick on Queen at Wembley '86 (Greatest concert video ever by the way!).
  I haven't worded it great, but what are your thoughts guys (and gals here on Facebook ;) )?_
