  _If you could step inside the body and live the life of any band member from any currently active band, who would it be and why?_

  _Im trying to flirt with a girl. Her favourite bands are 30 seconds to mars, the pretty reckless and young guns. Is there any hope?_

  _Olympic time guys.. but fuck sports. One rock/metal band from each continent (except Antarctica) that would win the gold medal for being the best band in their continent in 2016._

### Question of the week

* [**George Marsh**](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/1932829906943544/?type=3&comment_id=1933087950251073&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)
  _If it's not too late for a question:
  8 weeks ago my wife and I had a baby boy. Arthur (Arty) is our first, and so of course I'm looking forward to passing on 30odd years of useless information and bad habits. But I wanted him to have something more tangible than stories about festival experiences and first dates etc.
  So, I have decided that for each birthday I will buy for him two records, one classic/must have/changed-my-life record and a future classic from the last 12 months. On his 18th birthday he will be given the whole collection and a record player. This year I chose Prince - Purple Rain and David Bowie - Black Star (for obvious reasons).
  My question is; which album from the last 12 months do you think will be a future classic, and which legacy album would you want to pass on to a potential child?
  Cheers x_
