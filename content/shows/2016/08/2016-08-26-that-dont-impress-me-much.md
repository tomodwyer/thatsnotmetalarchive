  _Who are you heavy metal man crushes? Obviously, both of you being heterosexual means you don't FANCY them but you know, who do you look at and think "My god, that is one attractive man!"_

  _Is there any point in album artwork in this day and age? When I was a teenager I used to buy so much music based on the album artwork, but recently it seems bands don't really care anymore due to rise in digital sales. If I had never heard of Metallica and was browsing HMV/other music stores I probably wouldnt have picked up the new album due to the (in my opinion) atrocious artwork_

  _You have to cast an Avengers style movie where musicians in the rock world have to team up to save the world. Who do you pick and what powers do they get?_
