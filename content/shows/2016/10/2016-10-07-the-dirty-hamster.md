description: "It's one of the biggest weeks of the year as Hill and Beez review the new albums from Green Day, Alter Bridge, Sum 41, Meshuggah, NOFX and Steve needs a long lie down after hearing the new Set It Off. There's the 2nd round draw of our World Cup of Rock, chat on the new Creeper single, a new NIN album, 2017's festival season and much, much more. That's Not Metal - the only place willing to tell you the truth about the biggest albums in rock."
