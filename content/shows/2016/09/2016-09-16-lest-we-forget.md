## Questions

- **Jack Dillon**
*Which two people from the world of rock and metal would you like to see replace the Bake Off hosts Mel and Sue?*
- **Connor Roberts**
*Which song has the best riff outside of rock and metal?*
- **No name**
*Do metal heads actually care about lyrics? Many of the biggest metal bands write terrible lyrics and no-one seems to care. Also with most heavy bands you can't discern what is being said, and I don't know that people sit with lyric books whilst listening to albums anymore. Does it actually matter, or do metal heads listen to it because it sounds awesome regardless of what is being said, screamed, growled?*
- **Twitter user**
*We played this game at work today: Out of the entire history of music, you get any three bands or artists all at the peak of their powers. Your opening act get 30-40 minutes, your main support gets around an hour, and your headliner gets an hour and a half to two hours.*
