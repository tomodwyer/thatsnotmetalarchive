  _With the recent logo change from Rihanna, as well as pictures of Chris Brown in a thrasher jacket and Bieber in whatever Bieber was wearing, do you think metal is something that a lot of people are still embarrassed about liking, even when it's become more prevalent in the public eye? Or is it just media fodder to create a scandalous headline?_

  _Are ticket prices getting too high? I've just paid Â£80 to see RHCP's and Baby Metal like some sort of mug. What sort of price makes you want to pass on a gig?_

  _Seeing as it is transfer deadline day this week. Which members of bands would you transfer (either buy or sell) to make a band better. For me I'd put Keith Buckley in every band ever. His vocal ability is vocal ability is unparalleled and I think he could turn his hand to any genre._

### Question of the week

* [**Jamie Havard**](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/1948237148736153?comment_id=1948264942066707&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)
  _Do you see the 'need' to dress a certain way to be into a heavy music? I've been laughed at and called a poser just because I don't wear many band shirts, have any tattoos or a beard. Surely our scene is about being inclusive towards those who didn't fit in, why after all these years of listening, watching and being in bands should I still be worried about what I 'should' wear to a gig so I dont feel out of place?_
