  _You have to make a that's not metal mount rushmore, who would be on it and why?_

  _With Alt Magazines like Front and mammoth and multiple club nights featuring half naked fire breathing women, theme nights involving hot tubs and wet t shirt contests Is Britain's alt rock scene sexists and promoting lad culture? And do you think having the above mentioned is actually needed and makes today's alt scene less female friendly?_

  _You mentioned in the Slipknot special that you admired Corey Taylor's honesty in realising that Slipknot cannot go on forever. You said that in many ways you wished a few other bands would adopt this attitude rather than blemish their otherwise brilliant legacy. I'd like to know when you think would have been the best time for some bands to have called it a day? For example, Metallica after I Disappear, or maybe Guns N Roses following the break up of the Illusion line up?_

  _What do you make of Kerrang naming Lynn gunn of pvris as the greatest rock star in the world today? Are we lacking 'rockstars' in the 21st century, or are the media just lauding the wrong musicians?_

### Question of the week

* [**Elliot Leaver**](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/1921476044745597/?type=3&comment_id=1921485864744615&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)
  _When news broke of Of Mice and Men's Austin Carlile being baptised last week, I was amazed at the amount of snide comments directed at him simply for having a faith. As a Christian myself I know how much guts it takes to actually step out and publically acknowledge something like that, especially in society today, and my peers have all accepted my views and never let it bother them. Why is it that fans of a music genre supposedly accepting of all beliefs are so quick to judge somebody for simply stating that they believe in God or other higher deity?_
