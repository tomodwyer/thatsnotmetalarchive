  _Opinions and thoughts on "i grew out of it", "it's a phase you'll get over it" in terms of listening to rock/metal. I hear it all too often! Each to their own and all that but why is it seen this way? Hill has also mentioned the time he clocked out 'our world' briefly, and you touched on it with last weeks top question but I wanted to hear more from you guys._

  _Who do you think is the bets musician you've ever seen live? For me it's a toss up between Chris Adler and Synyster gates, both unbelievable live musicians._

  _You've talked before a bit about bands having 3 album arks. In your opinion, who has the best 3 album ark of the 21st century? letlive. is mine since slipknot's first three albums don't count because of the debut being released in '99._
