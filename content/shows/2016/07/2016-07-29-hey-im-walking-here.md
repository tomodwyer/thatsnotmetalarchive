  _Aside from your standard party bangers, What song/album do you shamelessly love more and actually only prefer when immensely inebriated? I recently discovered I only like "diary of Jane" by breaking Benjamin (yeah I said that out loud), when I'm sloshed._

  _Bill and Ted lend you their time machine for the night, which show would you go to?_

  _We're over half way through 2016 and there has been a lot of quality releases. But other than a select few (Architects, Gojira), the metal albums this year have been average, especially when compared to the new bands in the rock/punk/hardcore scenes. Is metal falling behind the other genres?_

### Question of the week

* [**Tony Bliss**](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/1929270617299473/?type=3&comment_id=1929302413962960&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D)
  _A recent opinion piece in Metal Hammer stated that the UK hasn't had a genuinely world-beating metal band since Bullet For My Valentine. Would you agree with this, and is it just a case of the media at large ignoring the huge potential of a British scene which, this year more than ever, is brimming with new, exciting bands?_
