  _Obviously rock music has seen the rise and fall of several genres in the mainstream over history: grunge, nu metal etc. What's been your favourite genre and era throughout musical history and what do you think will be the next thing to rise to the top and slide right back down again?_

* [**Patrick Heafield**](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/1925110167715518?comment_id=1925121161047752&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)
  _You're in an action movie, walking away in slow motion from a mass explosion behind you in your best suit and sunglasses. What song is playing in the soundtrack?_

* [**Adam Dowrick**](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/1925110167715518?comment_id=1925126251047243&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)
  _In the light of recent releases from RHCP and Blink, what are your thoughts on how bands early releases are seen once they go off the rails? Can you listen to One Hot Minute for example, without thinking about how shite they became? Particularly interested in Steve's thoughts on the Manics with this_

* [**Zahra Alrashed**](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/1925110167715518?comment_id=1925149801044888&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)
  _Are there any bands you didn't pay much attention to at the time but then they split up and you discovered you really liked them? I recently had this with my chemical romance - I was never fussed at the time but I recently read the book about them and revisited their earlier material and I am gutted I brushed them off and never saw them I'm their prime._

### Question of the week

* [Siobhan Crees](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/1925110167715518?comment_id=1925189667707568&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)
  _If you could create an EP (say five songs) titled the Life of Beez and one titled the Life of Stephen Hill what would you choose those five tracks to be?
  In case you're interested in the uncool Life of Crees EP, mine would be:
  This Year's most open heartbreak - FFAF
  Uptight - Green Day
  Look What happened - less than Jake
  Unholy Confessions - A7X
  Radio - Alkaline Trio
  What it is to burn - Finch_
