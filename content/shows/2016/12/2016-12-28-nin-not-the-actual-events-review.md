title: "NIN Not The Actual Events Review"
date: 2016-12-28
description: "Hill and Beez interrupt their Xmas to bring you a full review of Nine Inch Nails's first new music in 3 whole years. Not The Actual Events is available now and we discuss how it measures up to their past, what's new for them and what it means for the band's future. Yes, we realise that our review is ten mins longer than the EP itself. Sorry not sorry."
