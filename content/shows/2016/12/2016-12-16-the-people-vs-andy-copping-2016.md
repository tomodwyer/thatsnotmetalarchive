## The People vs Andy Copping

Is the reason GnR didn't get booked for Download purely because of the extortionate prices that could be charged for their own shows? It's a shame that in this world of touts trying to fleece fans at every opportunity that the bands would do it themselves.

Andy, describe your headliner process. Do u genuinely look into all headliner options for the year? For instance if that were true, you must of pursued A7x, Metallica, GnR, AC/DC, Foo Fighters, Blink 182, Green Day, Def Leppard, etc on top of those you have booked. What does that asking process look like? Did you have more than 3 options or did the others decline?

### [Trish Leggat](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/2014951178731416/?type=3&comment_id=2014966788729855&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)

How badly has the Brexit vote and subsequent GBP value plummet hit the booking process this year? Have you had to be even more creative to get value for money? And if it has had a negative effect on this year's booking process will we see a reduction in the number of bands playing? Or will we just see more UK based bands playing?

Digestives or Bourbons?

### [Andy Miles](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/2014951178731416/?type=3&comment_id=2014964655396735&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)

With that in mind - unlimited budget, every band in the world is available, ready and waiting - who would be the first bands you call up??

### [Christopher Kean](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/2014951178731416/?type=3&comment_id=2014956028730931&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)

Now were beyond the event can you go into any depth about the no clashes with Iron Maiden and the rumours of the same situation with Aerosmith this year. Both bands have previously clashed. Also related to thid the shorter nature of headline sets on other stages to reduce clashes with the headliners, shouldnt 2nd and 3rd stage headliners still get 90 minutes to 2 hours?

### [Thomas Knowles](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/2014951178731416/?type=3&comment_id=2014962838730250&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)

How did the decision change from "never booking Baby Metal" to eventually having them on the main stage come about?

### [Ryan Jenkins](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/2014951178731416/?type=3&comment_id=2014969285396272&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)

Do you feel Download would benefit from taking a year's break Glastonbury style, so that after 2 years a line up announcement would feel more fresh with more time for bands to break through onto the scene, as at times announcements can seem a little stale and predictable.

### [Thomas Power](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/2014951178731416/?type=3&comment_id=2014957325397468&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)

Hi Andy, what are you thoughts on genre defined stages, such as festivals like Hellfest. For example a hardcore stage, punk stage etc. Because with current stage splits it does feel like some bands can feel lost on some stages due to genre clashes. But with grouping bands of the same genre on one stage this could create a vibe for that stage which currently could be lacking.

### [Stephan Seiler](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/2014951178731416/?type=3&comment_id=2014971998729334&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)

There are some incredible festivals in other European countries who are matching lineups like Download's. However they are charging about a third of the price less. How can you justify that?

### [Ben Willmott](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/2014951178731416/?type=3&comment_id=2015001002059767&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)

Do you know what the demographic split of download is? When Biffy were announced I saw a lot of older folks (who like more monsters of rock kind of bands) saying how they were the biggest demographic and that for download to prosper long term, it should build it's lineup to cater primarily to that sort of music fan, and let reading cater for the younger audience. Is there any substance to this or are my age group (18-25) the biggest attendees?

### [Joanne Gray](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/2014951178731416/?type=3&comment_id=2015009508725583&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)

Since it seems to always rain at Download and moving the full festival is out of the question, is it possible to put down a floor or at least some kind of waterproof material in the festival? When the mud gets so bad it makes you miss bands and not enjoy the experience, it becomes a problem. This year the hay was only put down as a last resort when the damage was already done. I really want to go next year but finding it difficult to persuade others since the conditions were so bad this year ðŸ˜¢

Would you consider allowing artists to curate stages, Ã  la ATP or Roadburn?

### [Daniel McGuire](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/2014951178731416/?type=3&comment_id=2015023008724233&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)

If a new band was to start their career today, what do they have to do over the course of the next decade or so to be considered for a headline slot?

Is it all to do with the sizes of the venues they're playing, does the type of rock/metal music they're playing come into it?

For example, let's say a new band starts their career and they're a death metal band with no clean singing but they're able to sell out Wembley arena after 4 or 5 albums? Could you consider them for a headline slot, or would they simply not have the mainstream pull needed?\*
