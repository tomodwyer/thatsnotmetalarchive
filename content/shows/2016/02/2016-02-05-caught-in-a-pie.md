description: "Hill and Beez get bummed out by Phil Anselmo, discuss Kerrang!’s Top 50 metal albums, there’s reviews on Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Roam, Toothgrinder and Prong, Danny Worsnop and Asking Alexandria’s situations, we give you a taster of our member's Pantera special with Cowboys From Hell in Album Club. We also give the advice to never, ever, ever get caught doing naughty things with pies. Mmmm, tasty."
