description: "One of our best podcasts ever sees Hill and Beez discuss Hellfest vs UK festivals, Joey Jordison's week of revelations and review the new releases from Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nails and Spraygun War. Fall Out Boy's From Under The Cork Tree is our Album Club and you'll never, ever, ever listen to Disturbed the same way ever again."
