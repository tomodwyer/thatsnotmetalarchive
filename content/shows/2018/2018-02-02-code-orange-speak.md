## Questions

* **[Matt the metalhead](https://twitter.com/MattTheMetalhea/status/959152640260231168)**: _With the reaction to code orange being nominated for a Grammy do you guys see that as a sign for the potential explosion of our scene or was it just a flash in the pan?_
* **[Rob Barbour](https://twitter.com/puns_n_roses/status/959139182915530752)**: _HIFH & ATD-I at Trees. Gaslight album shows. An almost-certain MCR reunion. Is this an age of unparalleled nostalgia in rock & metal & is there an argument to be made that this is A Bad Thing? For many, 1 ticket to Gaslight = 1 ticket they didn’t buy to see, say, The Menzingers._
* **[Chris Lord](https://twitter.com/chrisdlord/status/959128880387969029)**: _Before you settled on TNM, were there any other contenders for the podcast's name?!_
