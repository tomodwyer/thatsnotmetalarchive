*If you were to assemble the worst possible metal band, which musicians would you choose?*
- **[Mike Ramm](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/1964003260492875?comment_id=1964034137156454&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**
*I went to see Feed The Rhino this weekend & it was really badly attended. Given this band were on R&L mainstage a couple of years ago, lauded as one of the best live acts in the UK (still are btw) and had released a critically acclaimed album does this prove how fickle fans have become or is it just the inevitable outcome of music now being free, & thus ultimately disposable?*
- **[Neil Abercrombie](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/1964003260492875?comment_id=1964064957153372&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**
*What's your opinion of only attending shows for the support bands? I have no interest in seeing pierce the veil, but am tempted by Creeper and letlive. as supports. I would personally feel guilty about paying for a show, only to leave before the headliner, but how would you feel over a bill with weak headliners but amazing supports?*

*You've said countless times on the podcast that you're waiting for another band like Nirvana or Slipknot to turn up and slap everyone in the face. Do you think that it's even possible today? I feel like people would instantly be criticising them on social media and saying they sound like whatever band. It's a negative view but I feel like the casual music fan is too cool to be part of something huge and exciting.*
