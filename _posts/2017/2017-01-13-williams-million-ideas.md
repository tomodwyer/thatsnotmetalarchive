Recently, Creeper fans have been paying crazy money for copies of the first two Creeper EPs. Upwards of £100 for something that came out at £10. Do you back the idea of making something limited and special and having fans then pay what they want for it, or do you think it should be easier for fans - especially a growing, devoted fanbase like Creeper's - to get hold of the things they want?*

A prime example is the Every Time I Die + letlive co-headline that's about to hit Australia.*
