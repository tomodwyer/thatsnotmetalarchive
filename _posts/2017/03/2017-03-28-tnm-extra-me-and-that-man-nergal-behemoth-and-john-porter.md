date: 2017-03-28
description: Stephen Hill catches up with Nergal (you'll know him from Behemoth) and British songwriter John Porter to chat in-depth about their new project, Me And That Man. What do an extreme metal artist and a folk songwriter have in common? How did this project come to pass? How do they define their new album, Songs Of Love And Death?

All of this plus a few tasty morsels about Behemoth's follow up to The Satanist, only on today's TNM Extra.
