Is streaming as a form of music consumption overly represented in calculating chart positions and if so, is this a factor which prevents artists from our scene breaking through and getting wider media coverage?*

So what bands would you recommend to a friend to go see live? Not necessarily to get them into rock music, but to show off our culture?*
