## Questions

- **Ali P**: *What are your opinion on warts and all documentaries / biographies? Something like The Hepatitis Bathtub humanises a band, whereas Some Kind of Monster just made the band look like out of touch crazies. Do you think there is a level where a band gets so big they should just make the music to stay relate-able?*

Which bunch of Metal scallywags and ne'er do wells would you like to see left in the jungle to eat Kangaroo aresholes and have cockroaches infest their undercrackers? Who'd win?*

Especially since they could have just called it quits after 14*

Stereophonics - Bartender and the thief - Crushing*
- **[Joe Heaton](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/photos/a.1814755825417620.1073741828.1814737015419501/1995380457355155/?type=3&comment_id=1995465177346683&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: *What's the most disappointing festival headline set you've ever seen? I'd say Black Sabbath this year at download. Even though I wasn't expecting great things it just sucked seeing a band that mean so much to you sound that bad.*
