title: "TNM Extra: Jamie Lenman"
date: 2017-07-25
description: Beez chats with Jamie Lenman about his time in Reuben to celebrate the reissue of the band’s final album, In Nothing Trust. We delve into the entire history of one of Britain's best bands of this century, Jamie’s teenage years and musical upbringing, the differences between being part of a band and a solo artist, what it’s like to be hated by Sum 41’s audience and much, much more in a feature length chat filled with laughs and astute observations from a man that we will lovingly call a national treasure. Listen to Reuben. Your life will be better for it.
